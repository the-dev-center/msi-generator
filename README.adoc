= MSI/MSIX Generator
:description: A cross-platform MSI/MSIX generator in D-lang

This project aim to replace WiX in CPack (CMake) by providing a pure D implementation for generating Windows Installer (MSI) and MSIX packages without depending on Windows-only binaries.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites
- D compiler (DMD, LDC, or GDC)
- dub (D package manager)

=== Build
[source,bash]
----
dub build
----

or for production readiness immediately (bypassing strict UUID typing issues):
[source,bash]
----
dub build --config=prod
----

=== Usage
[source,bash]
----
./msi-generator --name="MyApp" --id="com.example.myapp" --version="1.0.0.0" --exe="bin/myapp.exe" --output="myapp.msix"
----

== Antora Documentation

Documentation is located in the `docs` folder. To build the documentation:
[source,bash]
----
npx antora docs/antora-playbook.yml
----

== Development Notes

=== Dependency: asdf
This project currently requires a patched version of `asdf` for `std.uuid` serialization support.
A PR has been submitted upstream: https://github.com/libmir/asdf/pull/30

Once merged and released (version > 0.7.17):

1. Update `dub.json` dependency for `asdf`.
2. Remove local override: `dub remove-local z:\code\libmir\asdf`.
